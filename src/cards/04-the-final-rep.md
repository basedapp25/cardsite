### 04. The Final Rep
- Breaking mortal chains  
- Warrior's surrender

The weight presses down on you. Your lungs burn with each breath. This moment, suspended between collapse and triumph, reveals the truth beneath all the masks you wear. In these fleeting seconds you are confronted with a choice: will you allow your weaker nature to die on the altar of iron so something stronger can emerge?
Samurai warriors knew the presence of death intimately. Their code–bushido–taught them to live with the constant awareness that death was always near. Some samurai wrote jisei, a "death poem," to prepare themselves for the inevitable. They carried death in their hearts, not as a fear, but as a constant companion, a reminder that every action mattered, every breath counted.
You too meet death’s shadow–whether in the final rep, the freezing shower, or the task that looms, daunting and unyielding. Your mind screams stop, telling you to relent. Your heart knows otherwise. You push through. You die to weakness, to complacency, and rise reborn. Each time you face this moment, you transform.
Face the cold water like a samurai walking to battle, eyes clear, knowing the only way forward is through. Attack the hardest task first, as the catalyst for growth.
Choose three daily deaths:
- The dawn patrol (first alarm, no snooze)
- The iron tithe (one more rep than yesterday)
- The deep work gauntlet (no distractions, full focus)

Start small. Die daily. Rise stronger.

Questions for reflection:
1. Which version of yourself needs to die today?
2. What small death will you choose to face in the next hour?
3. What positive results can you expect in your life as you become a man who can let the past self die?
