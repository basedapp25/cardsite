### 02. The Bull
- Breaking comfort's chains
- Transformation through destabilization 

Milo of Croton, the legendary Greek Olympian, built his unmatched strength by hoisting a newborn calf each day, growing more powerful as the calf grew into a mighty bull. Japanese swordsmen practiced cuts until their arms could no longer lift the blade. Your shaking muscles carry forward this ancient lineage of voluntary hardship.

Physical destabilization rewires both body and mind. The shaking hands that can barely grip. The legs that buckle and twitch. These are markers of transformation, signs you've pushed past artificial limits. Let your body quiver. Your nervous system rebuilds stronger through temporary weakness.

Today's warriors face different battles, but the principle stands eternal: Growth demands destabilization. The project that terrifies you. The conversation you've avoided. The comfort zone that's become a prison. Break yourself strategically or life will break you randomly.

Questions for reflection:
1. Which area of your life most needs strategic destabilization right now?
2. What comfort have you maintained that's actually holding you back?
3. Where can you voluntarily introduce productive stress this week?
