### 08. Solomon's Frame
- Sacred proportions
- Strategic balance

Most men obsess over immediate victories while neglecting strategic wisdom. They win battles but lose wars. The wise king sees further. He builds systems that compound. Alliances that multiply force. Reputation that opens doors. Knowledge that cuts deeper than any weapon.

Solomon built his kingdom through wisdom, not brute force alone. When rivals plotted against him, he didn't respond with reflexive aggression - he deployed strategy, timing, and precise force. A kingdom built on nothing but raw power crumbles. One built with wisdom endures through ages.

Cultivate wisdom before action. Master timing before force. Know when silence speaks louder than words. When to build alliances instead of enemies. When patience serves better than aggression. Cut with precision, not rage. Strike with purpose, not pride.

Questions for reflection:
1. Where have you sacrificed long-term power for short-term dominance?
2. What three relationships or skills, if developed, would multiply your strategic position?
3. Name one area where patience and wisdom would serve you better than immediate action.
