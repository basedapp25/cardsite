### 03. Temple Cleansing 
- Sacred ritual preparation 
- Focused energy activation

Alexander knelt before his sword at dawn. Miyamoto Musashi cleansed his blade in the morning mist.  These warriors understood that battle was not confined to a single moment but was the culmination of a lifetime of preparation. Victory was forged not in the clash of steel but in the quiet, disciplined rituals repeated endlessly in the grindstone of daily effort. “A pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood,” General Patton declared to the third army on the eve of the D-Day invasion. His soldiers' lives stood as proof. 

Doing the hard, disciplined thing every day sharpens you into something unstoppable and sets you apart from those who falter. Clear your war room. Three minutes maximum. Music that awakens your savage heart. Place each weapon with conviction - laptop, weights, hammer, or pen. Breathe deep into your core. Name your prey, your goal for this session. See yourself standing over it victorious and move with violence of action.

Questions for reflection:
1. Which three specific actions would form your perfect pre-battle sequence?
2. What exact moment today demands your full ritual power?
3. How can you cut all wasted motion from your preparation?
