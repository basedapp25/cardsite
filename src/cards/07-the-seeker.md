### 07. The Seeker
Gathering wisdom
Maintaining your inner compass

The path of mastery requires both independent thought and the humility to learn from those with greater perspective.
History is filled with the figure of the true seeker — not one who waits for answers to fall from the sky, but one who takes action and hunts wisdom relentlessly. Mystics didn’t just sit in idle meditation, and philosophers didn’t merely ponder — they sought the truth with every ounce of their being, driven by an unyielding pursuit of wisdom. Kings weren’t born wise; they earned it through strategic learning, absorbing insights from the greatest minds around them to sharpen their rule.
Like the ancient strategist consulting the oracle before battle, the wise seeker understands that clarity comes through multiple lenses. In medieval courts, the most successful kings balanced their martial instincts with the wisdom of their advisors. The warrior who dismisses the magician's insights fights blind; the one who surrenders his judgment to others loses his sovereignty. There is a great power to the man who can see all options, who can then choose and take action unambiguously.

Stand at the crossroads with eyes both fierce and humble. Draw knowledge from those who have walked before you, but test every truth against your deepest knowing. Like Odin sacrificing his eye at Mímir's well, understand that new vision sometimes requires releasing old ways of seeing.

**Questions for reflection:**
1. What blind spots in your current path might others see more clearly than you?
2. Where has pride or stubbornness prevented you from considering valuable feedback?
3. How can you better integrate others' wisdom while maintaining your sovereign direction?
